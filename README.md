Overview of the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity

I completed the Data Analyst Nanodegree programme from Udacity (www.udacity.com) on Oct.7, 2016.
The programme is described as follows:
"We built this program with expert analysts and scientists at leading technology companies to ensure you master the exact skills necessary to build a career in data science. Learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, make predictions using machine learning, and clearly communicate critical findings."
The current Syllabus is in this directory.
The projects I completed at the end of each course are found here in github under links such as:
pradau/udacity (project 0 and 1)
pradau/udacityP<project number>  ( for later projects)

My certificate is uploaded in this directory as certificate.pdf
